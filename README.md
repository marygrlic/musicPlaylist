# musicPlaylist

Modern music streaming applications, like Apple Music and Spotify, allow users to stream digitally-copywrited music at their leisure. This Music Playlist project implements object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java and data strucutres like
circular linked lists to create and manipulate playlists. Some methods include createPlaylist, addAllPlaylists, insertSong, removeSong, mergePlaylist, shufflePlaylist, and reversePlaylist. 

This repository includes the PlaylistLibrary class, which holds all of the methods I have implemented and coded as a part of this project. There are .csv files (ex. playlist1.csv) as well as .wav files to test the methods. The PlaylistLibrary
class refers to other classes, including a Driver, which contains other methods and allows users to test the code I've written. 

Music Playlist was a project written from my Data Structures class at Rutgers University.
